module.exports = function(req, res, next) { // module.exports allows this to be used in another file. req refers to the request from the client, specifically focusing on any headers present on the request object. res refers to the response and will be used to present which types of headers are allowed by the server. 
    res.header('access-control-allow-origin', '*'); // res.header so that the server will respond with what kind of headers are allowed in the request. access-control-allow-origin header to tell the server the specific origin locations that are allowed to communicate with the server. The * is known as a wild-card; it means that everything is allowed. In this setting, its saying that requests originating from any location are allowed to communicate with the db (database)
    res.header('access-control-allow-methods', 'GET, POST, PUT, DELETE'); // these are the HTTP methods our server will allow
    res.header('access-control-allow-headers', 'Origin, X-Requested-With, Content-Type, Accept, Authorization'); // these are specific header types the server will accept from the client

    next(); // next sends the request along to its next destination. This could be an API endpoint or another middleware function designed to do something else. next() tells the middleware to continue its process
